# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon when a customer ends their relationship with a company. The objective is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
